# analytics

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/analytics.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/analytics)

This is a work-in progress project for working with declarative Datalog style programs as an embedded domain-specific language in Haskell.

The current focus is on getting a rich Datalog-esque EDSL that works nicely as a monad transformer, so you can mix and match it with
tools from other domains.

Skim the [examples folder](https://github.com/ekmett/analytics/tree/master/examples) to get started for now.
