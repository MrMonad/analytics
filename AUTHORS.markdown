Analytics was started by [Edward Kmett](https://github.com/ekmett) in response to a question by [Alec Heller](https://github.com/deviant-logic) about if he should use `bound` to implement datalog. It has since somewhat expanded in scope.

This project has been greatly enriched by opening it up to community development.

Many people have contributed patches, documentation, wiki pages, bug reports, test cases and code to `analytics` including (among others):
